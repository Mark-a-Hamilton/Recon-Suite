## 🧭 Reconnaissance Suite — Overview

The Recon Suite is a modular, ethically-grounded toolkit designed to support responsible security assessments. Built for clarity, flexibility, and auditability, it offers a structured approach to gathering surface-level diagnostics from client-approved environments.

> 🔒 **Important**: This repository contains documentation only. The actual scripts and tools that power the Recon Suite are maintained in a separate private repository to safeguard operational integrity and reduce misuse.

## 🛠️ What It Does

The Recon Suite helps security practitioners perform structured reconnaissance aligned with Rules of Engagement (RoE). It supports:

- ✅ **Scalable Recon Modes**: From lightweight hygiene scans to more advanced, client-consented probing.
- ✅ **Protocol-Aware Execution**: Flexibly handles HTTP(S), FTP, SMB, SSH, and other stack entry points.
- ✅ **Role-Based Modules**:
  - `Home`: Baseline visibility and hygiene checks for common misconfigurations.
  - `Passive`: Public signal gathering without active probing.
  - `Active`: Controlled, deeper interaction with endpoints based on client approval.

## 🔍 Why It's Different

Unlike generic recon tools, the Recon Suite emphasizes:

- 🧼 **Minimal Intrusion**: Noisy scans gated behind explicit consent.
- 📜 **Audit-Ready Logging**: Timestamped and hashed outputs for every module.
- 🔁 **Extensible Design**: Easy integration of new protocols and scanning logic.
- 🎯 **Client Transparency**: Recon paths tied directly to pre-agreed vectors in RoE documentation.

## ⚙️ How It's Used

The suite is launched via a central control script, which dynamically invokes module scans based on operator input and scope definition.

**Typical workflow:**
1. Choose protocol and target domain/IP.
2. Specify desired recon mode(s): hygiene (`h`), passive (`p`), active (`a`).
3. Launch recon-suite with applicable flags.
4. Review structured log output and use findings to guide next conversations with the client.

## 💬 Conversation-Driven Engagement

Recon Suite isn’t just about scanning — it’s about **starting the right conversation**. Its architecture helps consultants and clients collaborate:

- 📂 Identify assets worth protecting
- 🔐 Understand the stack surface and exposure points
- ⚖️ Prioritize remediation with clear, human-readable findings
