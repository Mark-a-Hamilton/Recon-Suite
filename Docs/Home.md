## 🏡 Recon-Home — Gentle Security Hygiene at the Edge

**Recon-Home** is the lightest touch in the Recon Suite family—a first-glance diagnostic script that helps assess basic system hygiene without raising alarm bells or probing too deeply.

Think of it as the front porch light: it illuminates common risks without crossing thresholds.

---

## 🌱 What Is It?

Recon-Home is designed for quick, safe checks across user-owned assets and staging environments. It quietly inspects:

- 🧹 Misconfigured services
- 🚪 Open or forgotten ports
- 🔍 Surface-level exposures (e.g. outdated headers or stale metadata)
- 📁 Directory and file inconsistencies

It's meant for environments where **consent is already granted**—whether you're validating home lab hardening, scanning internal infrastructure, or helping a client prepare for deeper assessment.

## 🤖 How It Works

- ⚙️ Operates autonomously when launched via the control script
- 🧩 Pulls scope and parameters based on user input (IP, domain, mode)
- 🪶 Runs low-noise checks using lightweight protocols
- 📄 Outputs findings to a timestamped, indexed log folder

No guesswork. No dangerous payloads. Just responsible recon.

---

## 🧠 Design Intent

Built to be:

- ✅ **Safe by Default**: No aggressive scans, no external calls unless permitted
- 🔄 **Repeatable**: Modular blocks that operate consistently across systems
- 🧾 **Auditable**: Outputs structured logs with timestamps and path references
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **User-First**: Designed to empower—not confuse—its operator

---

## 🌍 Use Cases

Recon-Home supports anyone looking to take a **first responsible step** in understanding their system's surface exposure:

- 🔒 Red Team prep (validating internal hygiene pre-deployment)
- 🧪 DevSecOps validation (checking staging assets before push)
- 🛠 Home lab enthusiasts (evaluating router, NAS, and VM surfaces)
- 🧠 Security education (demonstrating lightweight recon principles to learners)
