## 🫥 Recon-Passive — Silent Signal Gathering with Ethical Precision

**Recon-Passive** is the Recon Suite’s quiet diplomat. It scans publicly available information—not to expose, but to **observe**. It’s the bridge between discovery and dialogue.

Unlike hygiene scans (`recon-home`), `recon-passive` goes a step deeper: targeting URLs and domains **explicitly provided by clients**, operating entirely outside their perimeter, with zero active engagement.

## 🌐 What It Actually Does

This module carefully collects open-source intelligence (OSINT) across:

- 📦 Public metadata (DNS records, SSL certs, WHOIS info)
- 🧠 External signals (headers, server software fingerprints)
- 🧭 Tech stack indicators and redirect behaviors
- 🔍 Domain-linked exposures (cached files, favicon hashes, etc.)

And it does so using **non-intrusive methods**—meaning it never initiates active contact unless baked into the agreed methods.

## 🔐 Triggering It Responsibly

Recon-Passive is only launched **after the client provides an explicit public-facing target** (like a company domain or asset URL). It’s your ethical starting point prior to formal engagement.

Use cases include:

- 🗣 Pre-meeting research for professional engagement prep
- 🧩 Identifying assets the client may have forgotten
- 🧠 Sparking a useful conversation: “Did you know your SSL config leaks X?”

## 🧠 Architectural Touchpoints

Built to be:

- 🧵 **Modular**: Easily extended to pull new OSINT sources (Censys, Shodan, etc.)
- 🚦 **RoE-Aware**: No scope creep—targets only what's handed over
- 📄 **Indexed & Logged**: Timestamped folders, scoped logs, searchable output
- 📡 **Signal-Based**: Relies on HTTP headers, DNS leaks, and indirect profiling

This module reflects a balance of **depth and discretion**—something very few recon tools capture without going full active.

## 🧠 What It Says About You

Publishing this documentation showcases:

- 🧩 Your ability to architect tools that bridge passive intelligence and practical outcomes
- 📚 Your care with ethical triggers—never scanning what you haven’t been invited to
- 🔍 Your knack for gathering actionable insight **without** touching the target’s infrastructure
- 🛠 Your systems thinking: modules that coordinate, log, and stay scoped—even when working in shadow zones

## 💼 How To Use (Simplified Flow)

1. Receive a domain or public-facing asset from client (e.g. `https://example.com`)
2. Launch the control script and select **Passive** mode
3. Let recon-passive gather metadata, stack info, and indirect signals
4. Review structured output in the designated timestamped folder
5. Highlight interesting findings to **start the right security conversation**
