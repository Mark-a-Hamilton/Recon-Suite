## 🔓 Recon-Active — Deep Reconnaissance, Ethically Controlled

**Recon-Active** is the final tier in the Recon Suite’s progression. It performs deeper scans, privilege-aware probes, and network fingerprinting—but only after the boundaries have been defined, the target environment approved, and consent formally documented.

This isn’t just good practice. It’s policy.

---

## 🚫 When It Should Be Used

Recon-Active is **strictly post-engagement**. It operates on assets that have been explicitly agreed upon in writing (typically via a Rules of Engagement document). Targets may include:

- Internal servers
- User-facing login portals
- Federated systems
- Credentialed endpoints

Nothing about this script is speculative—it’s **precise, scoped, and deliberate**.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

Once launched through the Control Script, Recon-Active can:

- 📡 Probe internal service architecture (SMB, Kerberos, LDAP)
- 🔐 Test access control and authentication pathways
- 📜 Identify misconfigured TLS stacks or expired certs
- 🚪 Enumerate reachable shares, pivot points, and endpoint behaviors
- 💬 Simulate social engineering-friendly interfaces (without engagement)
- 📈 Generate fingerprinting hashes, audit logs, and context metadata

And all of it is tied to compliant logging and hash-indexed outputs for later review, team collaboration, or client briefing.

## 🧩 Designed for Control

- 🧱 **Gated by Consent**: Will not run unless selected explicitly
- 📑 **Logged and Signed**: Every action tracked, timestamped, and hashed
- 🧮 **Modular Expansion**: New tools or checks can be added without breaking integrity
- 🎯 **RoE-Aware**: Ports, protocols, and techniques map directly to agreed vectors

Recon-Active makes escalation measurable—ensuring no one goes too far, too fast.

## 🤝 Why This Matters

This module reflects your professional ethos:

- 🧩 Architecture that respects boundaries and trust
- 🛠 Tooling that adapts to rules, not overrides them
- 🧭 Workflows built around safety, clarity, and client empowerment

When shared publicly, this documentation showcases your understanding of **high-impact recon** tempered by **high-integrity design**.
